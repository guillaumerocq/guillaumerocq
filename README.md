## Current readings
* ***[Learning eBPF - Liz Rice - O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-ebpf/9781098135119/)***
  * ☝️ I intend to deep dive into this subject since I find numerous concrete application (i.e. from a cluster or host perspective, for observability purpose, ...)
    
* ***[Site Reliability Engineering - Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff, Niall Richard Murphy - O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/)***
  * In fact, this work is such an important foundation of many standards we use on a day-to-day basis, that it appears important to refresh up some concepts!

## Skydiving 🪂
This season, I am taking a break; I would like very much to jump again, but this is not a good timing.
<br />
Another pre-season event is coming next January/February (as it happen every year).
<br />
It takes place in Morrocco 🌴 ([Beni-Mellal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gErn2umfGE45wgTi7)) in the middle of beautiful mountains 🏔️ with an incredible weather ☀️☀️☀️
<br />
Goal is to graduate BPA ("***Brevet de Parachutiste Autonome***") on a two-year horizon.
